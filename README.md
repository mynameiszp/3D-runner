# 3D Unity Runner Game
The project is an engaging and dynamic game, inspired by "Subway Surf".
The game involves an avatar that runs and dodges obstacles, with the game speed gradually increasing over time. I have implemented features such as user registration, login, a main menu, and immersive gameplay. Additional feature is global leaderboard, which displays leaders all over the world.

The game is built using the Unity Engine and C#. I adhere to SOLID principles and utilize various design patterns to ensure our code is clean, scalable, and maintainable. I used such technologies as:
- Dotween for animations;
- Firebase Authentication and Firebase Real-Time Database;
- Object pooling for efficient obstacle generation. 

Branch main contains final version of the game.
